<h2>Movie Review</h2>

<p>
Interstellar is one of my favorite movies because of the soundtrack, story, and scientific inplecations for its time.
WHen this movie first reliesed, the depictions of blackholes and event horizons, and the events that happen inside the black hole were considered
to be very much as acurate as they could be for the time. 
<br>
The depiction of the blackhole was praised by scientists as one of the most realistc depictions according to data
and mathmatical formulas performed.
<br>
The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer in my opinion is just stunning and fits the movie perfectly.
I love the sountrack to this movie and enjoy listening to it whenever i feel like feeling goosbumps.
<br>
The Story is another very strong part of this movie in my opinion. I enjoyed the way that charecters grew,
and how plots and secrets were discovered.
